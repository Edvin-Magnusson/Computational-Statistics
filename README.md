# Computational Statistics

In this repository I have uploaded my assignments from the course Computational Statistics from Stockholm University 
- https://www.su.se/english/search-courses-and-programmes/st5101-1.516133 
- I have uploaded my answers in RMD format and in pdf format, but I would reccomend looking at the pdf files to see the output from the code.   

## Topics 
### Assignment 1 
- Linear equations and matrix calculation
- Optimization of a general function of one variable
- Optimization in experimental design

### Assignment 2 
- Two-dimensional minimization
- Integration with Simpsonâ€™s 3/8 rule
- Gauss-Hermite integration
- EM algorithm for mixture of normal components

### Assignment 3 

- Bootstrap for regression
- Simulation of power curves
- Sampling algorithms
- Markov chain Monte Carlo integration
